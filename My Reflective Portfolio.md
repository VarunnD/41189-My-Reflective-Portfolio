# 41189-My-Reflective-Portfolio

## Week 1 

### Describe in your own words what you've learnt.
Throughout the week 1 tutorial at 3pm I have gained valuable knowledge about the main differences between complex and complicated systems. I have also learnt that the term system has many different meanings and can be defined in several ways. Moreover, the most suitable defination that helped me understand the term system is : a group of interacting or interrelated entities that form a unified whole.
### Why is it important to learn?
It is important to learn and study upon human centred complex systems to gain knowledge in my career pathway.
### How does it connect to what you already know? 
### Was it difficult? Why/why not?
### What are some examples of this in action? 
### How can you put your learning into practice?
## To help you recap on some of the key ideas of this module, consider the following questions.  Include your thoughts in your reflective portfolio:
### Is everything a system?  Why or why not?
### As we have defined complex systems would a passenger aircraft qualify as one?
### Would the aircraft in question 2 qualify as a Complex Adaptive System?  Why or why not?
