## Week 1 

### What have I learnt this week?
Throughout the week 1 tutorial at 3pm I have gained valuable knowledge about the main differences between complex and complicated systems. I have also learnt that the term system has many different meanings and can be defined in several ways. Moreover, the most suitable definition that helped me understand the term system is : a group of interacting or interrelated entities that form a unified whole.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I now know that there are 3 types of system boundaries which include: open, closed and isolated boundaries. Also, due tot he class discussion i learnt that the universe is a isolated system. I now know that complex and complicated systems and entirely different in a whole. I also now know that complex adaptive systems are systems that are in a conctantly changing environment and change their behaviour for its survival. 
### What insights have I gained?
I have gained key insights such as social, physical and environmental changes can have aw major impact on a complex adaptive system. I have gained an insight of social systems which are systems that engage in human interaction that is influenced by sociatal norms. Also, technical systems are systems that include hardware and software and its processes are not considered part of its system. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Throughout the week 1 tutorial I have noticed my main weakness of class engagement and trying to engage into class discussions. My strengths would be listening in class and following along the powerpoint slides in sync with the tutor to gain the most amount of knowledge and learning as i can. I have also learnt that online learning has been very advantageous to me as I tend to learn faster online then in real life as I have to completely engage at all times. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I faced the challenge at first of understanding that a system can have various meanings and there are many types of systems. However, the social systems are very complex in nature therefore, it took me some time to fully understand the key characteristics of the system itself. I have trouble understanding complex systems but I am sure throught this semester I will gain valuable knowledge allowing me to fully learn the new concept. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time I would increase my class engagement and listen fully for the tutorials. I would also complete all pre work and hae a more organised approach to learning and online classes. Furthermore, I would look through the slides after class or during and try to make notes to help me understand and memorise key concepts of human centred complex systems. 
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The classs slides posted on canvas and all material found on canvas was very useful for my learning as an online student. It is very organised and easy to find things that you need.
