# 41189-My-Reflective-Portfolio

## Week 1 

### What have I learnt this week?
Throughout the week 1 tutorial at 3pm I have gained valuable knowledge about the main differences between complex and complicated systems. I have also learnt that the term system has many different meanings and can be defined in several ways. Moreover, the most suitable definition that helped me understand the term system is : a group of interacting or interrelated entities that form a unified whole.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I now know that there are 3 types of system boundaries which include: open, closed and isolated boundaries. Also, due to the class discussion I learnt that the universe is an isolated system. I now know that complex and complicated systems are entirely different in a whole. I also now know that complex adaptive systems are systems that are in a constantly changing environment and change their behaviour for its survival. 
### What insights have I gained?
I have gained key insights such as social, physical and environmental changes can have a major impact on a complex adaptive system. I have gained an insight of social systems which are systems that engage in human interaction that is influenced by societal norms. Also, technical systems are systems that include hardware and software and its processes are not considered part of its system. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Throughout the week 1 tutorial I have noticed my main weakness of class engagement and trying to engage into class discussions. My strengths would be listening in class and following along the powerpoint slides in sync with the tutor to gain the most amount of knowledge and learning as i can. I have also learnt that online learning has been very advantageous to me as I tend to learn faster online then in real life as I have to completely engage at all times. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I faced the challenge at first of understanding that a system can have various meanings and there are many types of systems. However, the social systems are very complex in nature therefore, it took me some time to fully understand the key characteristics of the system itself. I have trouble understanding complex systems but I am sure throughout this semester I will gain valuable knowledge allowing me to fully learn the new concept. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time I would increase my class engagement and listen fully for the tutorials. I would also complete all pre work and have a more organised approach to learning and online classes. Furthermore, I would look through the slides after class or during and try to make notes to help me understand and memorise key concepts of human centred complex systems. 
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The class slides posted on canvas and all material found on canvas was very useful for my learning as an online student. It is very organised and easy to find things that you need. 

## Week 2 

### What have I learnt this week?
Upon reflection, it was observed that through the module 2 slides available on UTS canvas were very helpful towards my learning and overall understanding of models. Here are some of the main things I learnt : 
* A model is a substitute of a real system 
* Modelling effectively begins from understanding and observing the real system itself. 
* The iceberg diagram of how to model. The iceberg diagram is a visual demonstration that helped me understand the concept of modelling and its main steps in order. Events, patterns, trends, underlying structures and mental models. By utilising this visual diagram it allows me to gain knowledge of how to achieve a systematic approach when modelling. 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
In reflecting upon the tutorial exercise, it was useful to observe that during week 1 my perception and understanding of models was completely different to my understanding in week 2. In week 1 I thought models were just a designed prototype of an existing object, however, after learning and listening during the class in week 2 I understood that models are much more complex than that and have many different types.  
### What insights have I gained?
In reflecting upon the tutorial exercise, it was useful to observe the complex systems and wicked problems in the world today and how there is not 1 solution, however the issues can be tackled by several solutions combined. problems such as droughts, economy, jobs, biodiversity etc. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
To reflect upon the learning process this semester, it can be argued that several factors influenced my strengths and weaknesses. My strength this week was understanding the model thinking concept quickly through the slides, however my weakness that I observed was understanding the wisdom hierarchy. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Upon reflection, the challenge was observed balancing university study load and my work load. I work casual around 38 hours a week so this is a major challenge for me to keep up to date with the weekly tutorials and gaining the most amount of learning with the time I have. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Upon reflection of my learning it is clear to observe that I need to spend more time learning and analysing the work slides better. To gain better understanding I should write notes in every tutorial to help me remember the small concepts discussed in class. 
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Upon reflection, it was observed that the model thinking concept and what models are. Those models can be complex and also simple. modelling has many interpretations and has several structures to them. 

## Week 3

### What have I learnt this week?
Upon reflection, I have learnt several aspects to the way humans behave and how it can be characterised into 3 main components. First being the rational modelling types, second being the behavioural models and the third modelling type is the rule based modelling. These modelling types helped me to understand the complexity of human decision making and the factors that influence decisions. 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
To reflect upon the learning process this semester, it can be argued that I now know the three types of modelling for the ways humans behave, the types of decision making of humans and what influences those decisions. Moreover, I now fully understand the complexity of human decisions and how they can be spontaneous in nature. I also learnt how people solve problems in groups and the social challenges that come along with it. 
### What insights have I gained?
Upon reflection, the insights I have gained through this weeks tutorial would be how innovation arises from 4 branches of problem solving which include:
* Perspective 
* Heuristics
* Team diversity 
* Recombination
All these elements can help tackle problem solving challenges and innovation. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
To reflect upon the learning process this semester, it can be argued that my strengths include understanding the way humans behave and their decision making processes. However, it can be argued that complex adaptive systems are a challenge for me to understand. There are 3 types of models: System dynamic, Agent based and Network models. I have trouble differentiating between these models. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
To reflect upon the learning process this semester, it can be argued that complex adaptive systems are a challenge for me to understand. There are 3 types of models: System dynamic, Agent based and Network models. I have trouble differentiating between these models.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Upon reflection, it is observed that spending more time on learning complex adaptive systems and doing all the class work, following tutorial slides would help to better understand the systems. To help my overall success in this subject I should spend more time making notes off the slides presented in each week's tutorials and asking questions if needed in class.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The shapely theory: Upon reflection, the shapely theory proved to be useful for identifying the conditions of:
* Efficiency
* Fairness/Symmetry
* Additivity 
* Zero property

## Week 4 

### What have I learnt this week?
To reflect upon the learning process his week, it is evident that I have gained valuable knowledge about system dynamics and the three main resistance policies: Feedbacks, Time delays and Nonlinearities. I learnt that systems are interdependent and have many forms of positive and negative feedback. 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upon reflection, it is evident that I now know the way feedback works in system dynamics. I have also gained knowledge about the key components in network modelling. Furthermore, the way system dynamics work and how each model provides pros and cons to systems has proved to give insights about how different types of networking are important.
### What insights have I gained?
Upon reflection the network models structure and its measures of structure is a key insight that I have gained this week. I understood and learnt that the measures of structure in a network are a direct result from the combination of these 7 components:
* Size 
* Density
* Diameter 
* Shortest path 
* Subgraphs
* Components
* Islands
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Upon reflection, week 4 proved to be a challenging week for understanding new terminology about complex systems. Upon reflection, my strengths would be understanding system dynamics completely and being able to apply them to real life scenarios. My key weakness in terms of learning would be class engagement, as I work around 40 hours per week it is hard to keep up with tutorial and lecture recordings 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Upon reflection of week 4, the key challenge I have encountered in terms of learning would be class engagement, as I work around 40 hours per week it is hard to keep up with tutorial and lecture recordings. Moreover, going through the module slides every week and always asking questions in class to boost my learning capability.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Upon reflection of this week's tutorial, I would suggest creating a timetable or schedule to go through module slides and lecture recordings every week to ensure I do not miss out on valuable class content. 
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Upon reflection of this week's tutorial,the theory or concept of system dynamic models allowed me to gain knowledge of how to use tools to analyse dynamic systems with interdependencies that include feedback and delays. 

## Week 5

### What have I learnt this week?
Upon reflection of the week 5 recorded tutorial, an abundance of learning and familiarisation with new concepts and model thinking has been achieved. Furthermore, the week 5 tutorial is mainly based on main ideas of aggregation and statistics. I gained valuable knowledge around the concept of distributions and aggregation. 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Reflecting upon week 5s tutorial and zoom recording, it is evident that I have understood complex systems through a broader perspective opening my mind to the new ideas and concepts of human centred systems. Upon reflection from class discussion, I now know about self organised criticality and its importance 
### What insights have I gained?
Upon reflection, it is clear to visualise the key insights of human centred complex systems throughout the tutorial I have gained insights about the many model thinking assignments which I was allocated to do the stakeholder. Finding out about the stakeholders in the social media platforms and creating a rihc picture based on my finding was quite interesting as I utilised a diagram software called draw.io.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Throughout reflecting weekly upon these GitHub entries, I have noticed an increase in memory recall for certain topics discussed in previous classes. The strength I have gained would be being able to remember concepts that were taught and discussed weeks ago. However, after reflecting upon my attendance and weekly engagement in online activities I have noticed a decrease in knowledge gained weekly as per usual. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Upon reflection, many challenges were faced for the assignment 1 on GitHub due to the fact my team was only just formed around the early week 5 stages. Creating groups through online messages and waiting for replies can become a challenge in the online environment. However, my group replied quickly we were in the same mindset as me. I messaged Evan on microsoft teams and talked to Benjamin and Christopher to form a group chat on facebook. This group chat, we share ideas and concepts to help us tackle any challenges faced for future assignment tasks.   
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Reflecting upon challenges faced and observed, it is clear to suggest effective communication methods between student and peers through the online environment. I would suggest being more open to creating group chats and sending messages confidently to ensure group participation and interest.  
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Reflecting upon all theories learnt during the 5 weeks, I gained interest in the aggregation of behaviours. This served me valuable knowledge of the outcome of concepts and the influence changes in behaviour have towards the outcome. This allowed me to gain insight on adaptable environment systems that predict the changes in behaviour of agents.
## Week 6

### What have I learnt this week?
Upon reflection of week 6, it is evident that throughout the week I have gained knowledge over these main ideas and concepts:

* Concavity
* Convexity
* Exponential growth model
* The basic growth model
* Markov process
* The Markov model

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upon reflection of week 6 online recordings and modules posted on canvas, I have gained valuable insight in the application of real life concepts in modelling frameworks. Furthermore, the random walks model was explained very well including all of the models fine details allowing me to understand the model to a higher standard.
### What insights have I gained?
Upon reflection of week 6 online recording and lecture, it was evident that I have gained a successful insight on the ideology of broadcast, diffusion and contagion. Furthermore, I have gained insight about the Bass model which combines the two diffusion and broadcast models into one which I found very interesting in this part of the semester. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Upon reflecting, my key strengths and weaknesses vary from week to week. I have gained a strong understanding of the subject structure and weekly input required to succeed in this subject. However, my weakness has to do with my weekly attendance and weekly tutorial engagement. I believe I need to work on being more engaged in class activities and have more conversations with group members.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Upon reflection of group activities and collaboration, it was evident that we carefully constructed and assigned assignment roles to individuals effectively and equally. The group leader was assigned to Evan Hunter as he took the lead in all conversations and ensured everyone knew what they were doing at all times. From peer review, Evan has been a great mentor and group leader for our assignments as he always reminds the group about deadlines and sections of assignments to do. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Upon reflecting on week 6 tutorials and lecture notes, it was evident that I need more class engagement in activities and exercises. Working 40 hours a week has been a constant struggle to keep up to date with tasks and class material. However, with the help of weekly github submissions and weekly lecture recordings I was able to slowly catch up to incomplete tasks. 
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

## Week 7

### What have I learnt this week?
Through accurate reflection of content through this week, I have learnt the segregation and peer effects, schelling's segregation model and how to measure segregation in particular. Granovetter's model has proven to be very interesting throughout the lecture notes as I have learnt a new perspective in the way people follow other people's actions. 
Furthermore, I have gained an understanding of the standing ovation model, coordination and culture and lastly the replicator model which was focused on in our GitHub assignment. 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
To reflect upon the learning process this semester, I have a great understanding of the standing ovation model and schelling's segregation model. It was interesting to gain a deeper view and perspective through learning such models as they can change the way you think of certain aspects of social interaction. Furthermore, I have gained interest in the replicator model which was heavily focused on for the group assignment. 
### What insights have I gained?
Through accurate reflection of content through this week, I have gained interesting insights about Granovetter's model and the replicator dynamics of the replicator model. Throughout the week the replicator dynamics model proved to be interesting as it consists of 3 main components such as Psychology, Ecology and Economics. Furthermore the replicator equation proved to be useful in the assignment where Evan suggested utilising this to highlight societies growth of social media platforms. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
To reflect upon the learning process this semester, the definitive weakness as discussed as before would be the online class engagement due to working. However, the strengths I have perceived includes being able to read and understand the lecture notes to a great extent. The notes are designed in a way which is fun to read and learn. The lecture notes are proven to be useful in explaining the main components of the model whilst maintaining the structural integrity of the script. The utilisation of pictures have made it a fun experience to learn and grasp onto new concepts. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Upon Reflection, my team has had the challenge of collaboration through github. As no one can see the progress of one's work until it is committed to the master branch. This left the group confused on who has done progress throughout the assignment. However, this is a new concept and software I have been using, therefore I have successfully adapted to the new concepts and changes within the assignment details and utilising github to its fullest potential. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
 From reflecting upon my weaknesses and disadvantages, to improve on these and to get better results and feedback would be to email and message more group members about any concerns or questions I have. This in turn would create a more collaborative environment for all users and increase my online engagement in activities.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Throughout this week, I have learnt many components and models however, one of those models proved to be the most interesting and relevant towards the assignment. Therefore the theory of the replicator dynamics model proved to be useful throughout the assignment as it is utilised to measure and explore the social media growth throughout ita platforms. 
## Week 8

### What have I learnt this week?
Through accurate reflection of content through this week, I have learnt about the applications of the colonel blotto model and the prisoner dilemma model which directly relate to a game strategy of winning. I found this very interesting the fact that models can be applied to the way one wins or loses a game. Furthermore, this week was the week of pre submission for the GitHub assignment. My group and I spent a lot of time collaborating on microsoft teams, however, mainly through facebook messenger where we asked questions and collaborated for effective group work.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upon reflection, I now know that models can be applied to the strategic approach of games etc. The Colonel Blotto Model and the Prisoner Dilemma model was a new and interesting ideology for me. Furthermore, I enjoyed the lecture notes through the pictures and diagrams highlighting and presenting the model.
### What insights have I gained?
Upon reflection of the process this semester, I have gained several insights towards the GitHub python markdown. I have gained valuable knowledge of how to utilise Jupiter notebooks and python in order to create the pre submission file. Python and GitHub is a new software/ language to me therefore, it was a major learning curve throughout the subject and semester of Human Centred Complex systems. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
To reflect upon the learning process this semester, my strengths would include the communication I had between my team members and associates. However the weakness would include the learning process of jupiter notebooks and setting up/ using the team github repository. Making commits to the master branch was challenging as I found out I was using the wrong software.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
To reflect upon the learning process this semester, the GitHub and jupyter notebook setting it up was rather challenging as I didnt know there was a tutorial posted on canvas until the next week. However, luckily my team members from my group 'emergence' helped me set it up correctly and taught me the right way to make commits towards the master branch. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Throughout this semester, I have an ongoing challenge with attendance and correct communication between group members, however to do better next time I would suggest myself to keep up with weekly notifications received from Juan and other emails sent out. This would in turn keep me updated and have a learning mindset before every tutorial throughout the weeks.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Reflecting from all the models presented throughout the week 8 lecture notes, it is evident that the COlonel Blottos Model stood out from the rest as it has a game perspective and strategic importance in terms of winning challenges. I found this very interesting throughout the week. 
## Week 9

### What have I learnt this week?
Upon reflection, this week has been drastically different compared to the other 8 weeks, as this week there is no content to learn. However the weeks are for the group assignment progress.

### What insights have I gained?
To reflect upon the learning process this semester, I have gained valuable knowledge on how to effectively use github and jupyter notebook to submit a github repository. I have gained insights about the way commits work in a group centred project on github. Furthermore, I have gained valuable insights throughout the semester of many model thinking approaches towards real life scenarios. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Upon reflecting this semester it is evident that the strengths and weaknesses are directly correlated with effort and engagement throughout the tutorial and classes this semester. I have learnt that the challenges within this subject have a heavy toll when not engaging fully into classes and group work activities. I learnt that it is crucial to keep up to date with the group work and have effective communication when it comes to creating a github file for the group. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
To reflect upon the learning process this semester, the challenges my team observed for the pre submission was the code for the github repository was not working. The file had some sort of coding error due to the fact someone in our group had changed the code for the file, therefore to resolve this issue Benjamin, Evan and I decided to revert the file tot the last saved commit. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
With anticipated results to do better next time it is crucial to have effective communication when doing group work activities especially on a new software that is a new concept to most of the members in the group. 

## Week 10

### What have I learnt this week?
This week had no new content, however, upon reflecting from other weeks and week 9 I have become more confident with my skills when utilising jupyter notebooks and the github repositories. I have learnt an amatuer understanding of the main components needed to submit/ make commits in the file and the reason the assignment is based on a github file. 

### What insights have I gained?
To reflect upon the learning process this semester, I have gained various insights about the assignment in particular creating the rich picture for the pre submission. Creating the rich picture for the assignment took place in week 8 however, the skills carried over for this assignment. I have gained knowledge of how to paste photos and screenshots into the master file. Thus giving me another insight into the new world of github.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Upon reflection of the learning this week, my perceived strengths would be the effective communication needed for the assignment. The communication and collaboration took place mostly on facebook messenger wehre the team members would ask questions and set dates that everyone was free to work on the assignment. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Upon reflecting from this semester I have encountered various challenges in terms of GitHub and many model thinking. The main challenge that would stand out throughout this semester is online engagement with the tutorials and presentations. This left me behind in all class work which was tough to manage during submission dates. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
 To reflect upon the learning process this semester, the main things I would improve on would include the pre existing code in the report to be left unchanged thus allowing the team to not have to revert the file to the last commit. 

## Week 11

### What have I learnt this week?
Through accurate reflection of content through this week, I have learnt the system dynamics modelling and the application of this model towards the idea of social media platform growth. To aid me in this understanding I had help from my team members which allowed me to ask questions and gather feedback for the assignment. This was a very helpful experience as I was able to manage my workload with theirs and produce a meaningful assignment.  
### What insights have I gained?
To reflect upon the learning process this semester, the insights I have gained this week are not that major as this week I was busy doing other assignments and didn't have time for the Human Centred COmplex systems assignment. Therefore, I have not gained any new insights however, the group has made some progress which I checked over the weekend.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Upon reflection within this week I have many weaknesses in managing time between different subjects and finding enough time to complete these tasks whilst simultaneously being engaged with work. Working 40 hours a week has proved to me that getting assignments done is possible however, requires a major effort and zero procrastination. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Reflection upon team challenges, it is evident that time management with the groups schedule and your own is significantly difficult. Therefore, Evan, Chris, Benjamin and I decided to create a meeting this weekend. The meeting was focused on setting up jupyter for those that haven't already and to talk about the progress needed to complete the many model thinking assignments. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
To reflect upon the learning process this semester, I would put more effort in the assignment as a whole and utilise the feedback to foster growth within my project.


## Week 12

### What have I learnt this week?
Through accurate reflection of content through this whole semester I have learnt various models and the way github works and also Python language. These basic knowledge can be utilised further throughout my career which is why i'm grateful for choosing such a complex subject that offers valuable knowledge for all members that engage. This semester has been rough with several fluctuations of lockdown due to the coronavirus. However, it has been a journey that not only brought me new knowledge, but was also able to make meaningful friendships with my peer group members. 

### What insights have I gained?
To reflect upon the learning process this semester, the subject is very complex in the way social interactions can be modelled in specific ways to convey meaning. The semester gave me bright insights into the real life scenarios that can be applied and understood through models. Not only giving me the opportunity to see the world through a many model thinking perspective, but also allowing me to use these models in life scenarios to help with a better outcome.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
To reflect upon the learning process this semester, my perceived strengths would be the long term effort and never giving up on assignment due dates. By keeping up to date with my github weekly entries I was able to find success throughout this subject. Furthermore, my weaknesses as explained throughout the whole report/ entry would be time management. Across the whole semester I have gained valuable knowledge about how to handle university assignments while working 40 hours a week at Amazon. This gave me not only time management skills, but long term hustling life skills that I can cherish. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Upon reflection, my team throughout this whole semester has been great. With the expertise of Evan, a third year student helping out all the group members as the team leader has allowed me to realise the potential a first year student has in many model thinking. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
 To reflect upon the learning process this semester, to do better next time I would definitely spend more time in class asking various questions and online engagement for all tutorials. This would keep me updated and have an even larger understanding of the many model thinking and human centred complex systems subject overall. It has been a wonderful journey and a valuable one.
