## Week 1 

### What have I learnt this week?
Throughout the week 1 tutorial at 3pm I have gained valuable knowledge about the main differences between complex and complicated systems. I have also learnt that the term system has many different meanings and can be defined in several ways. Moreover, the most suitable definition that helped me understand the term system is : a group of interacting or interrelated entities that form a unified whole.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I now know that there are 3 types of system boundaries which include: open, closed and isolated boundaries. Also, due tot he class discussion i learnt that the universe is a isolated system. I now know that complex and complicated systems and entirely different in a whole. I also now know that complex adaptive systems are systems that are in a conctantly changing environment and change their behaviour for its survival. 
### What insights have I gained?
I have gained key insights such as social, physical and environmental changes can have aw major impact on a complex adaptive system. I have gained an insight of social systems which are systems that engage in human interaction that is influenced by sociatal norms. Also, technical systems are systems that include hardware and software and its processes are not considered part of its system. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Throughout the week 1 tutorial I have noticed my main weakness of class engagement and trying to engage into class discussions. My strengths would be listening in class and following along the powerpoint slides in sync with the tutor to gain the most amount of knowledge and learning as i can. I have also learnt that online learning has been very advantageous to me as I tend to learn faster online then in real life as I have to completely engage at all times. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I faced the challenge at first of understanding that a system can have various meanings and there are many types of systems. However, the social systems are very complex in nature therefore, it took me some time to fully understand the key characteristics of the system itself. I have trouble understanding complex systems but I am sure throught this semester I will gain valuable knowledge allowing me to fully learn the new concept. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time I would increase my class engagement and listen fully for the tutorials. I would also complete all pre work and hae a more organised approach to learning and online classes. Furthermore, I would look through the slides after class or during and try to make notes to help me understand and memorise key concepts of human centred complex systems. 
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The class slides posted on canvas and all material found on canvas was very useful for my learning as an online student. It is very organised and easy to find things that you need. 

## Week 2 

### What have I learnt this week?
Upon reflection, it was observed that through the module 2 slides available on UTS canvas were very helpful towards my learning and overall understanding of models. Here are some of the main things I learnt : 
* A model is a substitute of a real system 
* Modelling effectively begins from understanding and observing the real system itself. 
* The iceberg diagram of how to model. the iceberg diagram is a visual demonstration that helped me understand the concept of modelling and its main steps in order. Events, patterns, trends, underlying structures and mental models. By utilising this visual diagram it allows me to gain knowledge of how to achieve a systematic approach when modelling. 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
In reflecting upon the tutorial exercise, it was useful to observe that during week 1 my perception and understanding of models was completely different to my understanding in week 2. In week 1 I thought models were just a designed prototype of an existing object, however, after learning and listening during the class in week 2 i understood that models are much more complex thn that and have many different types.  
### What insights have I gained?
In reflecting upon the tutorial exercise, it was useful to observe the complex systems and wicked problems in the world today and how there is not 1 solution, however the issues can be tackled by several solutions combined. problems such as droughts, economy, jobs, biodiversity etc. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
To reflect upon the learning process this semester, it can be argued that several factors influenced my strengths and weaknesses. My strength this week was understanding the model thinking concept quickly through the slides, however my weakness that I observed was understanding the wisdom hierarchy. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Upon reflection, the challenge of was observed balancing uni study load and my work load. I work casual around 38 hours a week so this is a major challenge for me to keep up to date with the weekly tutorials and gaining the most amount of learning with the time I have. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
upon reflection of my learning it is clear to observe that I need to spend more time learning and analysing the work slides better. to gain better understanding I should write notes every tutorial to help me remember the small concepts discussed in class. 
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Upon reflection, it was observed that the model thinking concept and what models are. That models can be complex and also simple. modelling has many interpretations and has several structures to them. 

## Week 3

### What have I learnt this week?
Upon refletion, I have learnt several aspects to the way humans behave and how it can be characterised into 3 main components. First being the rational modelling types, second being the behavioural models and the third modelling type is the rule based modelling. These modelling types helped me to understand the complexity of human decision making and the factors that influence decisions. 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
To reflect upon the learning process this semester, it can be argued that I now know the three types of modelling for the ways humans behave, the types of decsion making of humans and what influences those decisons. Moreover, I now fully understand the complexity of human decisions and how they can be spontaneous in nature. I also learnt how people solve problems in groups and the social chalenges that come along with it. 
### What insights have I gained?
Upon reflection, the insights I have gained through this weeks tutorial would be how innovation arises from 4 branches of problem solving which include:
* Perspective 
* Heuristics
* Team diversity 
* Recombination
All these elements can help tackle problem solving challanges and innovation. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
To reflect upon the learning process this semester, it can be argued that my strengths include understanding the way humans behave and their decision making processes. However, it can be argued that complex adaptive systems is a challange for me to understand. There are 3 types of models: System dynamic, Agent based and Network models. I have trouble differntiating between these models. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
To reflect upon the learning process this semester, it can be argued that complex adaptive systems is a challange for me to understand. There are 3 types of models: System dynamic, Agent based and Network models. I have trouble differntiating between these models.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Upon reflection, it is observed that spending more time on learning complex adaptive systems and doing all the class work, following tutorial slides would help be to better understand the systems. To help my overall success in this subject I should spend more time making notes off the slides presented in each weeks tutorials and asking questions if needed in class.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The shapely theory: Upon reflection, the shapely theory proved to be useful for identifying the conditions of:
* Efficiency
* Fairness/Symmetry
* Additivity 
* Zero property
