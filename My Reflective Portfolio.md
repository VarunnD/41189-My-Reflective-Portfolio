## Week 1 

### What have I learnt this week?
Throughout the week 1 tutorial at 3pm I have gained valuable knowledge about the main differences between complex and complicated systems. I have also learnt that the term system has many different meanings and can be defined in several ways. Moreover, the most suitable definition that helped me understand the term system is : a group of interacting or interrelated entities that form a unified whole.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I now know that there are 3 types of system boundaries which include: open, closed and isolated boundaries. Also, due tot he class discussion i learnt that the universe is a isolated system. I now know that complex and complicated systems and entirely different in a whole. I also now know that complex adaptive systems are systems that are in a conctantly changing environment and change their behaviour for its survival. 
### What insights have I gained?
I have gained key insights such as social, physical and environmental changes can have aw major impact on a complex adaptive system. I have gained an insight of social systems which are systems that engage in human interaction that is influenced by sociatal norms. Also, technical systems are systems that include hardware and software and its processes are not considered part of its system. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Throughout the week 1 tutorial I have noticed my main weakness of class engagement and trying to engage into class discussions. My strengths would be listening in class and following along the powerpoint slides in sync with the tutor to gain the most amount of knowledge and learning as i can. I have also learnt that online learning has been very advantageous to me as I tend to learn faster online then in real life as I have to completely engage at all times. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I faced the challenge at first of understanding that a system can have various meanings and there are many types of systems. However, the social systems are very complex in nature therefore, it took me some time to fully understand the key characteristics of the system itself. I have trouble understanding complex systems but I am sure throught this semester I will gain valuable knowledge allowing me to fully learn the new concept. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time I would increase my class engagement and listen fully for the tutorials. I would also complete all pre work and hae a more organised approach to learning and online classes. Furthermore, I would look through the slides after class or during and try to make notes to help me understand and memorise key concepts of human centred complex systems. 
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The class slides posted on canvas and all material found on canvas was very useful for my learning as an online student. It is very organised and easy to find things that you need. 

## Week 2 

### What have I learnt this week?
Upon reflection, it was observed that through the module 2 slides available on UTS canvas were very helpful towards my learning and overall understanding of models. Here are some of the main things I learnt : 
* A model is a substitute of a real system 
* Modelling effectively begins from understanding and observing the real system itself. 
* The iceberg diagram of how to model. the iceberg diagram is a visual demonstration that helped me understand the concept of modelling and its main steps in order. Events, patterns, trends, underlying structures and mental models. By utilising this visual diagram it allows me to gain knowledge of how to achieve a systematic approach when modelling. 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
In reflecting upon the tutorial exercise, it was useful to observe that during week 1 my perception and understanding of models was completely different to my understanding in week 2. In week 1 I thought models were just a designed prototype of an existing object, however, after learning and listening during the class in week 2 i understood that models are much more complex thn that and have many different types.  
### What insights have I gained?
In reflecting upon the tutorial exercise, it was useful to observe the complex systems and wicked problems in the world today and how there is not 1 solution, however the issues can be tackled by several solutions combined. problems such as droughts, economy, jobs, biodiversity etc. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
To reflect upon the learning process this semester, it can be argued that several factors influenced my strengths and weaknesses. My strength this week was understanding the model thinking concept quickly through the slides, however my weakness that I observed was understanding the wisdom hierarchy. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Upon reflection, the challenge of was observed balancing university study load and my work load. I work casual around 38 hours a week so this is a major challenge for me to keep up to date with the weekly tutorials and gaining the most amount of learning with the time I have. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
upon reflection of my learning it is clear to observe that I need to spend more time learning and analysing the work slides better. to gain better understanding I should write notes every tutorial to help me remember the small concepts discussed in class. 
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Upon reflection, it was observed that the model thinking concept and what models are. That models can be complex and also simple. modelling has many interpretations and has several structures to them. 

## Week 3

### What have I learnt this week?
Upon refletion, I have learnt several aspects to the way humans behave and how it can be characterised into 3 main components. First being the rational modelling types, second being the behavioural models and the third modelling type is the rule based modelling. These modelling types helped me to understand the complexity of human decision making and the factors that influence decisions. 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
To reflect upon the learning process this semester, it can be argued that I now know the three types of modelling for the ways humans behave, the types of decsion making of humans and what influences those decisons. Moreover, I now fully understand the complexity of human decisions and how they can be spontaneous in nature. I also learnt how people solve problems in groups and the social chalenges that come along with it. 
### What insights have I gained?
Upon reflection, the insights I have gained through this weeks tutorial would be how innovation arises from 4 branches of problem solving which include:
* Perspective 
* Heuristics
* Team diversity 
* Recombination
All these elements can help tackle problem solving challanges and innovation. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
To reflect upon the learning process this semester, it can be argued that my strengths include understanding the way humans behave and their decision making processes. However, it can be argued that complex adaptive systems is a challange for me to understand. There are 3 types of models: System dynamic, Agent based and Network models. I have trouble differntiating between these models. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
To reflect upon the learning process this semester, it can be argued that complex adaptive systems is a challange for me to understand. There are 3 types of models: System dynamic, Agent based and Network models. I have trouble differntiating between these models.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Upon reflection, it is observed that spending more time on learning complex adaptive systems and doing all the class work, following tutorial slides would help be to better understand the systems. To help my overall success in this subject I should spend more time making notes off the slides presented in each weeks tutorials and asking questions if needed in class.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The shapely theory: Upon reflection, the shapely theory proved to be useful for identifying the conditions of:
* Efficiency
* Fairness/Symmetry
* Additivity 
* Zero property

## Week 4 

### What have I learnt this week?
To reflect upon the learning process his week, it is evident that I have gained valuable knowledge about system dynamics and the three main resistance policies: Feedbacks, Time delays and Nonlinearities. I learnt that systems are interdependant and have many forms of positive and negative feedback. 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upone reflection, it is evident that I now know the way feedback works in system dynamics. I have also gained knowledge about the key componants in network modelling. Furthermore, the way system dynamics work and how each model provides pros and cons to systems has proved to give insights about how different types of networking are important.
### What insights have I gained?
Upon reflection the network models structure ad its measures of structure is a key insight that I have gained this week. I understood and learnt that the measures of structure in a network are a direct result from the combination of these 7 components:
* Size 
* Density
* Diameter 
* Shortest path 
* Subgraphs
* Components
* Islands
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Upon reflection, week 4 proved to be a challenging week for understanding new terminology about complex systems. Upon reflection, my strengths would be understanding system dynamics completely and being able to apply them to real life scenarios. My key weakness in terms of learning would be class engagement, as I work around 40 hours per week it is hard to keep up with tutorial and lecture recordings 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Upon reflection of week 4, thekey challenge I have encountered in terms of learning would be class engagement, as I work around 40 hours per week it is hard to keep up with tutorial and lecture recordings. Moreover, going thorugh the module slides everyweek and always asking questions in class to boost my learning capability.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Upon reflection of this weeks tutorial, I would suggest creating a timetable or schedule to go through module slides and lecture recordings every week to ensure I do not miss out on valuable class content. 
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Upon reflection of this weeks tutorial,the theory or concept of system dynamic models allowed me to gain knowledge of how to use tools to analyse dynamic systems with interdependencies that include feedbacks and delays. 

## Week 5

### What have I learnt this week?
Upon reflection of the week 5 recorded tutorial, an abundance of learning and familiarisation with new cocepts and model thinking has been achieved. Furthermore, the week 5 tutorial is mainly based main ideas of aggregration and sttatistics. I gained valuable knowledge around the concept of distributions and aggregration. 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Reflecting upon week 5s tutorial and zoom recording, it is evidient that I have understood complex systems thorugh a broader perspective opening my mind to the new ideas and concepts of human centred systems. Upon reflection from class discussion, I now know about self organised criticality and its importance 
### What insights have I gained?
Upon reflection, it is clear to visualise the key insights of human centred coplex systems throughout the tutorial
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Throughout reflecting weekly upon these GitHub entries, I have noticed an increase in memory recall for certain topics discussed in previous classes. The strength I have gained would be being able to remember concepts that were taught and discussed weeks ago. However, after reflecting upon my attendance and weekly engagement in online activities I have noticed a decrease in knowledge gained weekly as per usual. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Upon reflection, many challenges were faced for the assignment 1 on GitHub due to the fact my team was only just formed around the early week 5 stages. Creating groups through online messages and waiting for replies canbecome a challenge in the online environment. However, my group replied quickly were in the same mindset as me. I messaged Evan on microsoft teams and talked to Benjamin and Christopher to form a groupchat on facebook. This groupchat, we share ideas and concepts to help us tackle any challanges faced for future assignment tasks.   
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Reflecting upon challenges faced and observed, it is clear to suggest effective communication methods between student and peers through the online environment. I would suggest being more open to creating groupchats and sending messages confidently to ensure group participation and interest.  
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Reflecting upon all theories learnt the during the 5 weeks, i gained interest in the aggregration of behaviours. This served me valuable knowledge of the outcome of concepts and the influence changes in behaviour have towards the outcome. This allowed me to gain insight on adaptable environment systems that predict the changes in behaviour of agents.
## Week 6

### What have I learnt this week?
Upon reflection of week 6, it is evident that throughout the week I have gained knowledge over these main ideas and concepts:

* Concavity
* Convexity
* Exponential groth model
* The basic growth model
* Markov process
* The Markov medel

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upon reflection of week 6 online recordings and modules posted on canvas, I have gained valuable insight in the application of real life concepts in modelling frameworks. Furthermore, the random walks model was explained very well including all of the models fine details allowing me to understand the model to a higher standard.
### What insights have I gained?
Upon reflection of week 6 onlince recording and lecture, it was evident that I have gained a succesful insight on the ideology of broadcast, diffusion and contagion. Furthermore, I have gained insight about the Bass model which which combines the two diffusion and broadcast models into one which I found very intersting in this part of the semester. 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Upon reflecting, my key strengths and weakness vary from week to week. I have gained a strong understanding of the subject structure and weekly input required to succeed in this subject. However, my weakness has to do with my weekly attendance and weekly tutorial engagement. I belive I need to work on being more engaged in class activities and have more conversations with group members.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Upon reflection of grouo activities and collaboration, it was evident that we carefully constructed and assigned assignment roles to individuals effecitvely and equally. The group leader was assigned o Evan Hunter as he took the lead in all conversations and ensured everyone knew what they are doing at all times. From peer review, Evan has been a great mentor and group leader for our assignments as he always reminding the group about deadlines and sections of assignments to do. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Upon reflecting of week 6 tutroials and lecture notes, it was evident that I need more class engagement in activities and excecises. Working 40 hours a week has been a constant struggle to keep up to date with tasks and class material. However, with the help of weekly github submissions and weekly lecture recordings I was able to slowly catch up to incomplete tasks.
